## Week 1: Introductions
#### Or: Gitting to know you

### Introductions:
I'll tell you a bit about myself, then I'd like to hear a bit about each of you. What's your name, program, favorite breakfast food... the usual.

### Brief Overview of the Course
- equipping your toolbelt with version control, debugging, interactive consoles, text editors
- developing a foundation of JavaScript knowledge
- creating web maps using JavaScript 
- publishing web services via desktop GIS (the esri way)
- consuming web services within a web mapping application

### Your Amazon EC2 Instance
To hopefully make things easier for us, we'll be using virtual machines hosted by Amazon. We'll spend some time at our first meeting getting the wrinkles ironed out in terms of connecting and establishing a routine of *shutting down your instance* when you're not using it.

### Overview of this week
1.  Connect to your EC2 Instance.
2.  Connect your EC2 Instance to GitHub.
3.  Introduction to GitHub.
  -  Forking
  -  Cloning
  -  Issues
  -  Commits
  -  Branches
  -  GitHub Pages
  -  General Git workflow
4.  Quick introduction to Leaflet

### Your assignment
There are going to be a lot of facets to this course, so starting with GitHub may seem a bit odd for a class ostensibly all about maps, but hopefully you all see some method to my madness. Here's what you need to do for this week.

First, if you aren't familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and GitHub, take advantage of the bounty of online learning materials out there. See the syllabus for some
